# Cirrhosis-Dataset-Analysis

Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that occurs when healthy liver cells are replaced by scar tissue, also known as fibrosis. This scarring prevents the liver from functioning properly and can eventually lead to liver failure. We are going to be analyzing a dataset from information collected from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984 of patients with cirrhosis from stages 1-4. Our goal is to create a classification model that can accurately predict the stage of cirrhosis someone has based on a number of predictor variables and identify which variables are most influential to the models. It is an important classification problem, because we could identify which predictors are clear indicators of cirrhosis, and ultimately narrow down the amount of testing needed to classify someone with cirrhosis. We have 16 predictor variables. There are 6 categorical variables and 10 quantitative variables. 5 of the categorical variables are related to other conditions directly related to cirrhosis for example, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). These are all binary variables coded as Y/N. The other 10 quantitative variables have to do with various metrics that are important to liver health. We will be using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting methods to create classification tree models to analyze the data.
